Hello, and welcome to Interactive Mad Libs!

This is a project where we give users a random story to fill in.  They don't know what it is about yet, so when they fill in all the questions, they will be surprised and amazed at the story they read!

In the near future, we hope to allow users to bring in their own unique stories for others to fill in, so as to create a very interactive, collaborative experience!
